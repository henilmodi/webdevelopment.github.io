            <p style="padding-left: 80px; padding-right: 80px; margin-top: 50px;">HTML stands for <b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext <b>M</b>arkup <b>L</b>anguage. </b></i>HTML5 is the latest evolution of the standard that defines HTML.It is a new version of the language HTML, with new elements, attributes, and behaviors, and a larger set of technologies that allows the building of more diverse and powerful Web sites and applications. HTML5 is a markup language used for <b>structuring and presenting content</b> on the World Wide Web(www). HTML5 was first released in public-facing form on <b>22 January 2008</b>, with a major update and <i><b>"W3C Recommendation"</b></i> status in <b>October 2014</b>. Its goals were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia and other new features; to keep the language both easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and devices such as web browsers, parsers, etc., without XHTML's rigidity; and to remain backward-compatible with older software. HTML5 is intended to subsume not only HTML 4 but also XHTML 1 and DOM Level 2 HTML. </p><br>

            <p style="margin-top: 50px;">CSS stands for <b>C</b>ascading <b>S</b>tyle <b>S</b>heet. CSS is a simply <b>designed language</b> intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable. CSS allows you to apply styles to web pages. CSS <b> saves a lot of work</b>. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once. More importantly, CSS enables you to do this independent of the HTML that makes up each web page. CSS is easy to learn and understood but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document.

           <h2 style="text-align: center;">What is Javascript?</h2>
            <p style="margin-top: 50px;">JavaScript is a <b>cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive</b> (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.).  There are also more advanced server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you to add more functionality to a website than simply downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
